	<h1>	About Us</h1>
	<p><h4>Post-Graduate College has five decades of rich and spectacular history, one whose total contents defy description but from which, atleast major events can be highlighted. The inception of TERI in 1994 was one such path-breaking moment.
	In April 1956, we formed the Degree College Association-a philanthropic society for promotion, Integration, creation and dissemination of knowledge. It is an umbrella association, which has conceptualized and constituted from time to time, several academic, scientific and technical bodies, concordant with societal needs and global academic environment.
	Realizing the growing importance of technical and professional job-oriented education, we pioneered in offering MCA, MBA and Environmental Science courses-hitherto available at select universities and engineering college-to students of eastern up at most affordable cost. As envisaged in our Vision-2005, we also commenced BBA and BCA programmes in the year 2005.
	We have constantly moved up the growth ladder sans profit-motive. Our faith in spiritual rather than material values has kept us impermeable to contaminations introduced by market forces ushering value-based education that promoted human excellence and enhances competitive abilities in today's academic world is Herculean task in itself.
	We nurtured a dream to become a leading technical institute with a global vision. Today, the dream has become a reality as TERI academicians and students alike have gained due recognition for their academic and professional excellence. As Chairman of TERI I welcome you to this fascinating Institution. Looking forward to your valuable association with us.
