		A Contact Us page provides guidance for existing customers and offers an overview of your brand for new visitors.
		A strong Contact Us page should contain several elements, such as a phone number and links to social media channels.
	 	It should also be easy to navigate, as this makes for a positive customer experience.</h4>
